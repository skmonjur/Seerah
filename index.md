                        <p>Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “None of you have faith until I am more beloved to him than his children, his father, and all of the people.”</p>
                        <cite>More or less translation of Sahih al-Bukhari 15, Sahih Muslim 44</cite>
                        <p>How can one love someone they dont know about?</p>
                        <p>Seerah or biography of Prophet Muhammad pbuh is one of the most neglected area of knowledge in our times. Most of us only know our Prophet pbuh via a range of well known hadith and fail to connect to the real human being existed on the face of earth.</p>
                        <p>Every Muslim must know the biography of their Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him. We are now living in a digital world where books have been replaced by devices of many forms. This small, simple and insignificant attempt In Sha Allah is one of many future steps to come to from the Ummah to include the new generations and introduce them to the Seerah (i.e. Biography) of our beloved (pbuh). </p>
                        <p>Seerah lecture series of <a href="https://muslimcentral.com/series/yasir-qadhi-seerah/">Yasir Qazi</a> was game changer for me, I went back to them multiple times and can do that again and again without "Well, I knew this" attitude, as everytime I find something new that I didnt understand previously. I took the advise from Nouman Ali Khan's lecture to go and learn about seerah. For me it was a level up in terms of knowledge, from average to above average Alhamdulillah. Since then I have read few other sources and listened to others who worked on Seerah, and this is just a result of all their hard work. There is no way a sincere Muslim who goes through the Seerah can remain same as before without the uplifted connection with the Prophet pbuh. May Allah bless all the people working hard, day and night to uphold and follow the religion of Allah according to the way of Prophet Muhammad peace and blessing be upon him.</p>
                        <p>Allah has sent Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) as a mercy to the whole humanity, someone from whom we are supposed to learn. If we dont know about his pbuh struggle and strategy to overcome the burdens, we may never succeed in this world and the one to come after this.</p>
                        <p>Most of the details were taken from the book, "When the Moon Split" (1998) compiled by Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri. I highly recommend everyone to read his book "Rahikul Makhtum (Sealed Nectar)" to gain more in depth and detailed knowledge on the subject. If one takes this advise and picks up the book and reads it, I will consider that as a huge success from this small project. May Allah give us ability to do more.</p>

                        <p>From <cite>When the Moon Split 1998</cite> we explore some possible hikmah of the way the Prophet pbuh and companions dealt with the opression, however Allah knows the best</p>
                        <li>The companions (Ra) were being trained to face the torture and punishment on the path of Allah</li>
                        <li>They were able to endure due to their lack of attachment with the Duniya and eagerness for the bliss of Paradise</li>
                        <li>They were positive about the future of Islam knowing and beleiving that Allah will complete the matter and make Islam the dominant religion of God on the face of Earth</li>
                        <li>Peaceful preaching was effective in Makkah instead of fighting as that would trigger hatered and more bloodshed instead of the spread of the message</li>
                        <li>Fighting between Qurayesh and Muslims would mean to the outsiders that Islam came to initiate fight amongst family members</li>
                        <li>Muslims were few in numbers so the message would get hard to get outside of Arabia if all were engaged in fighting and getting killed at that stage</li>
                        <li>There was no real need for fighting as Islam was growing slowly but steadily</li>

                        <li>Prophet pbuh wanted to save and ensure the spread of the message and hence he sent some Mulsims to a land of just king</li>
                        <li>People of Abissinya were Christians (Abrahamic Religion) opposed to the people of Makkah who were pagans this was an advantage for Muslims</li>
                        <li>Prophet pbuh knew about Abissinya from his pbuh nursemaid Umm Aiman about the land and its people</li>
                        <li>As a merciful Leader Prophet pbuh was concerned about the safety and freedom of his pbuh followers and hence he pbuh permitted Hijrah option for them to go and live a safe life and spread the message</li>
                        <li>In the group there were Companions (Ra) like his pbuh dauther (Rukaiya Ra), son in law (Uthman Ra) and his pbuh cousin Jafar ibn Abu Taleb, which shows he pbuh was not taking a mere chance wih the life of some followers and including his pbuh beloved family members in that decision too</li>
                        <li>This also shows even though his pbuh family members had to suffer the same fate as his followers / companions (Ra)</li>
                        <li>These migrations (1st and 2nd Abissinyan migrations) lowered the status of Qurayesh as others in Surrounding areas were kind eough to provide shelter to their (Qurayesh's own tribesmen) people. And it als became obvious they (Qurayesh) were prosecuting Muslims because they worship only Allah and no one else</li>

                        <li>Once Makkans realised Prophet pbuh was sincere and was not prepared to back off, they were determined to find out whether or not Muhammad pbuh was really a Prophet</li>
                        <li>Makkans sought help from Jewish rabbis</li>
                        <li>Rabbis taught them three questions to ask the Prophet pbuh <cite>When the Moon Split 1998</cite></li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>Rabbis taught Qurayesh to ask Prophet pbuh about the youth of the cave</li>
                           <li>The next one was to ask about the Jul Kar Nayeen, the one travelled thoughout both the East and the West</li>
                           <li>They also told Makkans to ask the Prophet about "Soul"</li>
                           <p><cite>When the Moon Split 1998</cite></p>
                        </ul>
                        <li>The first two questions Allah swt addressed in Surah Qahaf, surah no 18</li>
                        <li>To address the third question 17:85 was revealed, "And they ask you about the soul. Say, “The soul is something from the command of my Lord, and you are not given from the knowledge but a little.”"(more or less meaning and Allah knows the best)</li>
                        <li>Again another proof that the Prophet pbuh was not making things up on the go and was admitting his pbuh limits which were being revealed by Allah</li>
                     </ul>

                  <div class="panel-body">
                     <p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>People of Qurayesh wanted to humiliate Prophet pbuh and prove him as a lier, so they asked him pbuh to perform miracles</li>
                        <li>Poor Qurayesh like many others of our days make the same mistake. It is not with the Prophets or anyone else who when they want can perform miracles, unless Allah gives them the ability to do so</li>
                        <li>And they have sworn by Allah the most earnest oaths, that, indeed, in case a sign comes to them, indeed they will definitely believe in it. Say, "Surely the signs are only within the Providence of Allah; and what will make you (i.e., the believers) aware that, when it comes, they will not believe?" (More or less meaning Quran 6:109)</li>
                        <li>Some of their demands are recorded in the Holy Quran, here are some of them (more or less translation of the meaning)</li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>They said, “We shall never believe in you unless you cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth.(Quran 17:90)</li>
                           <li>Or you have a garden of date palms and grapes, then you bring forth rivers from their midst in abundance.(Quran 17:91)</li>
                           <li>Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you claimed, or you bring Allah and angels before us face to face.(Quran 17:92)</li>
                           <li>Or you have a house made of gold. Or you ascend to the sky, and we will not believe in your ascension unless you send down to us a book we may read.” Say, “I proclaim the Purity of my Lord. I am nothing but human, a messenger.” (Quran 17:93)</li>
                           <li>Nothing prevented people from believing, when guidance came to them, except that they said, “Has Allah sent a man as a messenger?” (Quran 17:94)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Its amazing how the above verses are found in Surah no 17, Al Israh where the greatest miracle of all times that were given to any other Prophet as we know were recorded, i.e. Prophet Muhammad pbuh visitng the seven heavens with angel Gabriel (as) which included witnessing the glimples of afterlife,  meeting with other Prophets and above all, meeting with Allah in a way that befits our Prophet pbuh and Allah swt which we are unable to comprehend and only know about this via Quran and hadith</li>
                        <li>Allah responds to these, "If We had sent down to them the angels, and the dead had spoken to them, and (even if) We had gathered everything before them face to face, still, they were not to believe, unless Allah would have so willed. But, most of them adopt the way of ignorance. (More or less meaning of Quran 6:111)"</li>
                        <li>Angel Gibarel / Gabriel (as) came to Prophet pbuh and gave two options as a response. The first option was to give the Qurayesh what they wanted as a sign or miracle, but they still remained as disbelievers they will be destroyed and the second was the one of mercy, where no miracles would be given as they demanded, but the door of mecry will remain open for them. Our beloved Prophet pbuh made the wise decision and took the option of mercy</li>
                        <li>Still there was a miracle shown by the Prophet pbuh of splitting the moon which the Qurayesh rejected saying that must be a spell that Prophet pbuh has done on them</li>

                           <li>so as he was at a distance like that of two bows (joined together), rather even nearer. (53:9)</li>
                           <li>Thus He (Allah) revealed to His slave what He revealed. (53:10)</li>
                           <li>The heart did not err in what he saw. (53:11)</li>

                           <li>Indeed he saw him another time (53:13)</li>
                           <li>by Sidrat-ul-Muntahā (the lote-tree in the upper realm), (53:14)</li>

                           <li>The eye neither went wrong, nor did exceed the limit. (53:17)</li>
                           <li>He has indeed seen a part of the biggest signs of your Lord. (53:18)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>In an attempt to prove the Prophet pbuh was lying, Makkans who were familiar with Jerusalem were asking the Prophet pbuh to describe the sacred mosque</li>
                        <li>Prophet pbuh, described everything in details</li>
                        <li>Makkans still disbelieved</li>
                        <li>If one wants to lie for their own benefit, this was a very wrong time to do so as they have no support at their home town without any family members to stand by them</li>
                        <li>Someone told Abu Bakar (ra) about this journey and Abu Bakar simply said, If he pbuh is saying so, then it must be true</li>
                        <li>From that day Abu Bakar (ra) was called "Siddeque", the one who believes</li>
                        <li>Prayer was revealed to Prophet during this journey, initially 50 times a day, later Prophet pbuh listened to the advise of Prophet Musa / Moses (pbuh) as he had experience with the Bani Israel people (his ummah) who were commanded less than 5 times  day and still were unable to carry on their duties. Finally Allah obligated 5 times prayer for Muslims, the Ummah of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)</li>

                           <li>The Prophet pbuh prayed to Allah for a sign</li>
                           <li>When he went back to his people, Tufayl's face was radiant</li>
                           <li>His people were reluctant to accept Islam, however his wife and father immediately became Muslim</li>
                           <li>By the time he migragted to Madinah about 70 to 80 families from his tribe had accepted Islam and they accompanied him on the journey to Madinah</li>

                           <li>He was a skilled exorcist</li>
                           <li>He was from Yemen as well</li>
                           <li>He heard that Prophet pbuh was insane and he approached him pbuh to offer cure</li>
                           <li>The Prophet responded by saying (more or less meaning of the translation), "All praise be to Allah". We golorify Him and seek His help. He whom Allah has guided can not be misled and him whom Allah has led astray cannot be guided. I bear witness that there is no good except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is his servant and Messenger."</li>
                           <li>Dhimad was so impressed by these words (its way more elequent in Arabic) that he repeated thrice and said, "I have heard the speeches of sorcerers, soothsayers and poets, but never before have I heard anything like this."</li>
                           <li>He then asked the Prophet pbuh to extend his pbuh hand so that he could pledge his allegiance to him pbuh.</li>

                        <li>There were some Jews tribes living with Aus and Khazraaj</li>
                        <li>Occassionally disputes would flare up between Arabs and Jews</li>
                        <li>The Jews minority would intimidate the Arabs by saying that soon a Prophet would be sent to lead the Jews in battle. The Arabs they claimed would be defeated and slaughtered like the people of Aad and Iram</li>
                        <li>These six pilgrims were sitting together in Mina one night when the Prophet pbuh passed by. He pbuh approached them and asked (more or less meaning of the translation), "Who are you?". "We belong to the Khazraaj tribe", they responded. "Allies of Jews?" the Prophet pbuh commended (more or less meaning of the translation). The Prophet pbuh recited some Quran, invited them to Islam and to believe in Allah alone as the one and only God</li>
                        <li>They recognised the Prophet pbuh and thought, this is the same Prophet the Jews constantly threaten su with. Let us pledge allegiance to him pbuh before they (Jews) do.</li>
                        <li>All of the six men accepted Islam</li>
                        <li>"We left our people in such a plight (difficult situation). If Allah unites us through you, you wold be the honored more than anyone else among us", they said to the Prophet pbuh</li>

                        <li>Sa'd bin Mu'adh went back to his people and said, "What do you know about me as a man among you?". They replied, "You are our chief and the wisest man among us!".

				  <li>13th year of the Prophet's pbuh mission, many pilgrims visited Makkah from Madinah, in them there were both Muslims and Pagans and alike</li>
				  <li>The Muslims wanted to invite the Prophet pbuh to move to Madinah. They arranged a secret meeting with the Prophet pbuh after Hajj at Akabah</li>
				  <li>A total of 73 of the Muslims went individullay or pairs by keeping the private meeting a secret and this is known as the Second Pledge of Akabah</li>
				  <li>All but 11 were frim Khajraj trbie. There were two women in the group</li>
				  <li>Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib, Prophet's pbuh Uncle was with him pbuh. His pbuh Uncle was not a muslim yet. He (ra) said, Prophet pbuh has both security and honor in Makkah and if the Muslims from Madinah cannot give security to the Prophet pbuh then they should leave the Prophet pbuh to stay at Makkah</li>
				  <li>The Prophet pbuh recited some verses from the Quran and took the follwoing oath:</li>				
				  <ul>
				  <li>"We will worship none but Allah and we will never associate any partner with Him"</li>
				  <li>"We will obey the Prophet pbuh"</li>
				  <li>"We will give our wealth freely in properity and poverty"</li>
				  <li>"We will counsel others to do good deeds and instruct them to refrain from evil"</li>
				  <li>"We will server Allah, even when others show contempt"</li>
				  <li>"We will protect the Prophet pbuh as we protect our women and children"</li>
				  <li>Additionally according to Ubada (ra) they took pledge not to disobey the ones in Authority</li>		  
				  </ul>
				  <li>One of them asked, "O Prophet pbuh, We are bound to our people by a covenant, and by pledging loyality to you, we are about to cut off all our old ties. If success comes to you and you should conquer Makkah, will you return to Makkah then and leave us defenseless?"</li>
				  <li>The Prophet pbuh smiled and said (more or less meaning could be), "No! Blood is blood, and destruction is destruction. I am off you, and you are of me. I will wage war against those who make war upon you, and be at peace with those who are at peace with you."</li>
				  <li>Another one of them asked, "Tell me O Prophet pbuh, what do we get in exchange for all of this?"</li>
				  <li>"Paradise" the Prophet pbuh replied simply (more or less meaning)</li>
				  <li>All took the Prophet's pbuh hand and took the oath</li>
				  <li>The two women present took oath without shaking hands with the Prophet pbuh</li>
				  <li>After the pledge the Prophet pbuh asked the people to select 12 men who would be responsible for their affairs in the community</li>
				  <li>9 from Khajraj and 3 from Aus tribe were chosen</li>
				  <li>After the 12 were elected, the Prophet pbuh said (more or less meaning which could mean), "You are like the apostles of Isa (Jesus) pbuh. You are responsible for the community [in Madinah] while I am the caretacker of the entire body of Muslims"</li>
				  <li>Next morning Qurayesh heard a rumor about the pledge at Akabah, went to Madinah camp to protest against what happened</li>
				  <li>The ploytheists of Madinah didnt know anything so they declined the claim</li></ul>

                  <li>Marriage with Zaynab (Ra), reason being Zaynab (Ra) was wife of Prophet's pbuh adopted son Zaid</li>
<ul>
<li>Allah commanded this marrage</li>
<li>"...So when Zaid totally lost interest in keeping his wife, We gave her to you in marriage... <cite>(Quran 33:37, more or less meaning and Allah knows the best)</cite>"</li>
</ul>
                  <li>Marriage with Ayesha (Ra), reason being Aisha (Ra) according to one narration was very young at the time of the marriage</li>
<ul>

<li>Prophet pbuh was inspired by a dream about this marriage which is recorded in saheeh al bukhari</li>
<li>Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to me, "You were shown to me twice (in my dream) before I married you. I saw an angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth, and I said to him, 'Uncover (her),' and behold, it was you. I said (to myself), 'If this is from Allah, then it must happen.' Then you were shown to me, the angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth, and I said (to him), 'Uncover (her), and behold, it was you. I said (to myself), 'If this is from Allah, then it must happen.' " <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:7012"><cite>Sahih al-Bukhari 7012</cite></a></li>



</ul>



<li>People who have problems with these two marriages of Prophet pbuh are two types, Muslims with weak faith / imaan and enemies of Islam</li>
<li>Problem with the first group can be dealt by saying, if they beleive Prophet pbuh as a Messenger of God, then they should have no propblems with what God has commanded or inspired him pbuh to do. It is a part of beleif</li>
<li>According to further study and investigation we come to know that Arabs at the time of the Prophet pbuh was not maintaining any calender as such, so its very poosible for them to use a very rough estimate of time and mention their age</li>
<li>Number system speciallay the ones that involve counting more than ten was only familarised after the Arabs found out about the number Zero from Indians, hence it could be very possible for them (i.e. Arabs) to avoid using the numbers that are greater than ten prior to that time and Allah knows the best</li>
<li>A further in detailed study could be found here regarding the matter <a href="http://hameem.org/2019/02/11/proof-that-aisha-was-over-15-years-old-when-she-married-the-prophet-peace-be-upon-him/"><cite>Proof That Aisha Was Over 15 Years Old When She Married The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him)</cite></a></li>

                  <li>The second pledge of Akabah changed the equation for the Muslims, they now had a safe place to migrate to</li>
				  <li>Muslims who were able to, started migrating to Madinah slowly</li>
				  <li>Prophet pbuh, Abu Bakar (ra) and Ali (ra) were still in Makkah</li>
				  <li>Prophet pbuh was waiting for the permission of Allah to migrate</li>
				  <li>Abu Bakar (ra) had two fast camels which he (ra) would feed well to prepare for the migration when permitted by Allah</li>
				  <li>The Qurayesh were enraged that the Muslims had found a place in the Arabian peninsula</li>
				  <li>They were also concerned that Muslims would become strong and could control the Northern trade routes and disrupt the Pagan routes for trade</li>
				  <li>Makkans depended on the goods brought from Northern Arabia and Syria, hence the fear was real</li>
				  <li>There was a growing worry that Propht pbuh will move to Madinah at some point and establish a new power base there</li>
				  <li>To discuss all these cocerns a special meeting was called at Dar Al Nadwah, the Parliament of the Qurayesh</li>
				  <li>Iblees was also present in the meeting as Shaikh Jaleel of Najd</li>
				  <li>Suggestion was made to drive the Prophet pbuh out of the territory</li>
				  <li>Shaikh Jaleel (Iblees) didnt like the idea and said, "Do you not see how sweet his words are, and how he wins the hearts of people? If we exile him, he will simply find another tribe and make them his followers. With their help he will attack your city and deal with you as he pleases. Think of another plan"</li>
				  <li>"Let him imprison until he dies, like the poets of olden times", another one suggested.</li>
				  <li>"By God, if you make him a captive, the news will surely reach his companions who love him more than their father and sons. They might raid your territory and free him. Once their number increase, they will return and conquer you! Think of another plan", said Shaikh Jaleel</li>
				  <li>Abu Jahl, himself a rival of Iblees, put forth his idea. "I have my own opinion", he began. "I see none of you have touched on it so far. We will select strong and smart person from each of our noble tribes. Each one will be given a sowrd, sharp and deadly. Those will approach and kill the Prophet as one man. Sicne all the tribes will share his blood, Bani Abd Manaf the protector of the Prophet will not be able to fight all the other Qurayesh tribes at one time. They will then have to accept the blood money that we can give them easily"</li>				  
				  <li>Shaikh Jaleel said, "This is the best plan of all"</li>				  
				  <li>Meanwhile Jibrael (as) came to Prophet pbuh with the tidings that Allah had ordered the Prophet pbuh to migrate</li>	
				  <li>Prophet pbuh was informed about the assassination plan and the exact time he pbuh needs to depart. He pbuh was advised not to sleep at the same bed he pbuh used to sleep</li>				  
				  <li>At noon when everyone takes nap Prophet pbuh went to the house of Abu Bakar (ra)</li>
				  <li>They planned and prepared and took a guide to show them the way, who knew the area well</li>
				  <li>The guide was a Non Muslim</li>
				  <li>The Prophet pbuh told the guide to meet near Mount Thawr in three nights</li>
				  <li>In the meantime the Prophet was engaged in his pbuh day to day activity so that none could suspect that he pbuh was about to leave Makkah</li>
				  <li>The Prophet pbuh used to go to sleep after evening prayer and he would wake up at the middle of the night to pray Tahajjud (supplimentery) at Kabah</li>
				  <li>The night Prophet pbuh was going to leave, he pbuh told Ali (ra) his cousin to sleep at his bed at his bed and assured there will be no harm done to him</li>
				  <li>When everyone went to sleep, the assassins gathered around the Prophet's pbuh house</li>
				  <li>They saw Ali (ra) sleeping there wrapped in Prophet's pbuh green mantle and thought it was the Prophet pbuh</li>
				  <li>The Qurayesh failed to realise, when they were plotting, Allah too was planning: "And (recall) when the disbelievers were conspiring against you to hold you as a captive, or to kill you, or to expel you. They were planning, and Allah was planning, and Allah is the best planner."(More or less translation of Quran 8:30)</li>
				  <li>The Prophet pbuh spread some dust over the head of the young boys by reciting this verse in arabic: "And We have placed a barrier in front of them and a barrier behind them, and (thus) they are encircled by Us; so they do not see.(More or less translation of Quran 36:9)"</li>
				  <li>The youths outside the house couldnt see the Prophet pbuh leaving the house</li>
				  <li>He pbuh went to Abu Bakar (ra) and together they started their journey not towards Madinah, but towards Yemen, opposite direction to Madinah</li>
				  <li>Before dawn they covered a distance of 5 miles approximately and reached and took refuge in the cave of Mount Thawr</li>
				  <li>Unaware of the Prophet's pbuh escape the assassins continued to wait for the Prophet pbuh to come out</li>
				  <li>Only at dawn when Ali (ra) woke up and came out they (Qurayesh) realised they had been tricked</li>
				  <li>They aked Ali (ra) about the Prophet pbuh but he pleaded ignorance,they took him to Kabah and kept him there as a captive</li>
				  <li>Then they rushed to Abu Bakar (ra)'s house, only to find out that he also disappeared</li>
				  <li>Abu Jahl slapped Abu Bakar's (ra) daugther Asma (ra) and she didnt give out any information</li>
				  <li>The Qurayesh announced 100 camles on each of these two individulas, dead or alive</li>

                  <li>Abu Bakar (ra) was the one to first to enter the cave and clear away anything that might injure the Prophet</li>
				  <li>Something stung Abu Bakar's (ra) foot when Prophet pbuh was sleeping and due to the pain, tears of Abu Bakar (ra) fell on the Prophet's pbuh face and he pbuh woke up. Abu Bakar did not want to interrupt the sleep of the Prophet pbuh and hence he didnt move. Prophet pbuh then applied his spittle and the unjure and pain disappeared</li>
                  <li>During these three days, Abu Bakar (ra)'s son Abdullah would pass his nights nearby. The clever young man would return to Makkah early in the morning and Qurayesh would have no idea where he spent his night. Each day he would collect information about the activity of the Qurayesh and every night he would update the Prophet pbuh and Abu Bakar (ra)</li>
                  <li>Abu Bakar's (ra) Amir bin Fuhayra slave would graze Abu Bakar's (ra) goats near the cave, so that they could drink fresh milk. Early in the morning Amir would take the goats back along the same way Abu Bakar's son Abullah took to obscure the footprints</li>
				  <li>Search party were very close to the cave once and Abu Bakar (ra) became very worried, the Prophet pbuh said, (more or less which could mean), "How can you be apprehensive about two with whom is a third, especially when the third one is Allah?"</li>

				  <li>The guide hired by Prophet pbuh arrived at Mount Thawr with Abu Bakar's (ra) two camels. Abu Bakar's (ra) slave Amir (ra) accompanied them. The guide took them towards Yemen and the towards west in the direction of Red Sea and before reaching the sea they went towards north towards Madinah, a route which not many people used to go to Madinah.</li>
				  <li>They travelled all night and half of the next day, then they stopped to take rest. Abu Bakar (ra) found someone who let him some milk</li>
				  <li>Afterwards they travelled further 130 miles approximately and they met a woman who didnt have anything to offer to the travells in terms of food. She had a  weak goat which didnt have any milk. The Prophet pbuh took permission to milk it and the woman agreed. Milk flowed from the goat's udders and soon there was a full bowl of milk. He pbuh gave the lady to drink it. Then each of them drank to their fill. When they all finished, he pbuh milked again and left the bowl full of milk for the lady</li>
				  <li>The lady informed the matter to her husband when he came back, who said, "That was the man from the Qurayesh that I have been hearing about. If I ever have the opportunity, I will join his followers"</li>
				  <li>On the third morning after the Prophet's pbuh departure people of Makkah heard a voice echoing through the streets. They were unable to find where it was coming from because it was not a voice of a human being. It was a jiini saying: "Allah, Lord of the People, bless those two companions who reached the tent of Umm Ma'bad. In safety, they broke their journey, and in safety they resumed it. Anyone who befriends Muhammad finds success. O Qurayesh! By driving Muhammad away, you have forfeited (i.e. lost) glory and dominion! Blessed is the tribe of Banu Ka'b! Their Lady's tent became a refuge for Muhammad. Ask your lady about the weak goat and milking bowl. The goat will also inform you if you ask it."</li>
				  <li>A man named Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju'shum Madlaji spotted after the Prophet pbuh left Qadid. He thought he could catch the fugitives and take them to Macca to and claim the reward. As he tried to go foward, his horse stumbled suddenly and he fell down. Being superstritious, he drew arrow to findout what to do. The arrow he drew was unfavourable, however greed made him get up and try again. He fell down again as the forelegs of the hourse sank in to the sand. He cursed the horse and when looked behind he saw dust rising from the hoof print of the horse like smoke. He quickly pulled out another arrow to find out its bad omen for him to chase. Now he was convinced that he will not be able to catch the Prophet pbuh, he gave up. He then called the Prophet pbuh and surrendered. Tre group stopped for Suraqa to come and catch up. Suraqa offered food by they refused. The Prophet pbuh told him not to tell the Qurayesh about his pbuh whereabouts. Suraqa agreed and asked to be given a letter of safe conduct for future security. The Prophet pbuh asked Amir to write the letter on a piece of tanned leather.</li>
				  <li>Suraqa then returned toward Makkah. He told all the bounty hunters he met to go back because he had already searched the area and the fugitives were nowhere to be found.</li>
				  <li>The Prophet continued his pbuh journey and on the way he pbuh met Burida bin Husayb Aslami along with seventy or eighty families of his followers. They all embraced Islam and prayed the evening prayer with the Prophet pbuh. Barida migrated to Madina after the battle of Wuhud</li>
				  <li>The Prophet pbuh also met Abu Tamim Aus bin Hajr at Arj. At the time the Prophet pbuh and Abu Bakar (ra) were riding the same Camel as one of their Camel became weak. Abu Tamim offered them a camel and a slave. Although Abu Tamim became a Muslim he remained at Arj. He would later prove useful to the Muslims in the Battle of  Uhud by sending wrod through the slave about the Makkan's advance toward Madina</li>
				  <li>When the Prophet pbuh reached the vally of Reem, he met Zubayer bin Awwam (ra) who was accompanying a trade caravan of Muslims returning from Syria. He presented the Prophet pbuh and Abu Bakar (ra) with sheets of white cloth</li>

					  <li>Fourteen years after becoming a prophet, on a Monday the Prophet pbuh arrived in Qubaa on the outskirts of Madina</li>
					  <li>The people of Madina had long awaited for the Prophet pbuh and each day they would go and wait for the Prophet to be seen from distance so that they can prepare and welcome him until the sun used to get very hot</li>
					  <li>One day the people returned to their homes after waiting for a long time. A jew happened to catch a glimpse of a small group of white robed travellers in the distance. He called out, "O people of Arabia! What you have been waiting for has arrived!"</li>
					  <li>The Muslims rushed to greet the Prophet pbuh</li>
					  <li>After reaching Qubaa the Prophet pbuh sat in silence. The Ansars (i.e. helpers) who didnt see the Prophet pbuh beofore, did a mistake by thinking Abu Bakar (ra) is the Prophet. Abu Bakar (ra) had his hair grown a little grey, hence the confusion. Once Abu Bakar (ra) held a sheet to give shade to the Prophet pbuh, people realised their mistake</li>
					  <li>The Prophet pbuh stayed at Qubaa for four days and layed the foundation of the first Masjid (i.e. mosque) in the history of Islam</li>
					  <li>Prophet pbuh kept moving to Madina from Qubaa and when he pbuh reached close to Banu Salim bin Auf, it was time for Friday Congregational prayer. The Prophet pbuh led a hundred Muslims approximately, in Friday pryaer.</li>
					  <li>After the Friday prayer the Prophet and his entourage left for Madina</li>

					<li>Understand that Islam has enemies and you will not be able to practice Islam when compared to any other religion in the world as it is not like any other religion of the world.</li>
					<li>Once understood, it becomes easy to comprehend whats happening around the globe in our times</li>
					<li>The enemies of Islam plot and plan to eliminate Islam from the face of earth and they do not take rest. This is not a new phenomenon, its there from the time of Prophet Adam (as)</li>
					<li>Its a duty of Muslim to plan and action accordingly to carry the message of Islam and let others know the Truth.</li>
					<li>Setting and and achieving goals are very important and needs to be in the mind of every Muslim individual</li>
					<li>RasulAllah PBUH made a very well thought and careful plan before he pbuh migrated to Madinah</li>
					<li>It is permissible for a Muslim to take help from a trustworthy disbeliever</li>
					<li>Women played important roles in Hijrah as well as other areas of the religion</li>
					<li>Even though he pbuh was hated by the Qurayesh for what he pbuh was preaching, everyone trusted him pbuh and kept their valuables with him pbuh. Lets build that standardard first, especially in countries like this were we live and work with many Non Muslims, we have an excellent opportunity to build that trust and then if we tell them the ultimate truth, it will be easy for them to accept. We need to first learn how to live like a Muslim and then preach Islam, unfortunately many of us doing the opposite. We need to set a high standard and maintain it</li>
					<li>An ideal leader should have knowledge, wisdom and be willing to make many sacrifices</li>
					<li>The Muslims of Makkah made a tremendous sacrifice when they migrated to Madinah, we have to have a mindset to sacrifice when it comes to chose between this world and the next. Most of the time we cut the corners and tend to close our eyes when we go for Home Loans, Car loans, Student Loan, Certain type of Questionable jobs etc. We need to understand the sacrifice of our time and dont compromise for the sake of this world</li>
					<li>The Muhaajiroon are praised by Allah in many aspects. Areas they have been praised are, sincerity, patience, truthfulness, carrying out struggle for the sake of Allah, trusting in Allah alone, hoping for Allah's mercy, following the sunnah of the Prophet pbuh, having true emaan, having the honor of being the first to embrace Islam and being the people of ultimate success</li>
					<li>The Hijrah opened the known world to Islam and the spread of Islam continues until today</li>
					<li>The Muslims who were able to migrate but didnt, were threatened by Allah with a severe punishment</li>
					<li>The Muslims who were unable to migrate were forgiven by Allah</li>

					<li>Climate of Madina didnt suit well for the Imigrants</li>

					<li>Allah granted this prayer, the immigrants regained their health and began to love Madinah, they found the city becoming more and more of a home to them</li>
