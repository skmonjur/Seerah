<p>Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “None of you have faith until I am more beloved to him than his children, his father, and all of the people.”
</p>
<cite>More or less translation of Sahih al-Bukhari 15, Sahih Muslim 44</cite>

<p>How can one love someone they dont know about?</p>

<p>Seerah or biography of Prophet Muhammad pbuh is one of the most neglected area of knowledge in our times. Most of us only know our Prophet pbuh via a range of well known hadith and fail to connect to the real human being existed on the face of earth.</p>

<p>Every Muslim must know the biography of their Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him. We are now living in a digital world where books have been replaced by devices of many forms. This small, simple and insignificant attempt In Sha Allah is one of many future steps to come to from the Ummah to include the new generations and introduce them to the Seerah (i.e. Biography) of our beloved (pbuh). </p>



<p>Seerah lecture sereis of <a href="https://muslimcentral.com/series/yasir-qadhi-seerah/">Yasir Qazi</a> was game changer for me, I went back to them multiple times and can do that again and again without "Well, I knew this" attitude, as everytime I find something new that I didnt understand previously. I took the advise from Nouman Ali Khan's lecture to go and learn about seerah. For me it was a level up in terms of knowledge, from average to above average Alhamdulillah. Since then I have read few other sources and listened to others who worked on Seerah, and this is just a result of all their hard work. There is no way a sincere Muslim who goes through the Seerah can remain same as before without the uplifted connection with the Prophet pbuh. May Allah bless all the people working hard, day and night to uphold and follow the religion of Allah according to the way of Prophet Muhammad peace and blessing be upon him.</p>

<p>Allah has sent Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) as a mercy to the whole humanity, someone from whom we are supposed to learn. If we dont know about his pbuh struggle and strategy to overcome the burdens, we may never succeed in this world and the one to come after this.</p>

<p>Most of the details were taken from the book, "When the Moon Split" (1998) compiled by Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri. I highly recommend everyone to read his book "Rahikul Makhtum (Sealed Nectar)" to gain more in depth and detailed knowledge on the subject. If one takes this advise and picks up the book and reads it, I will consider that as a huge success from this small project. May Allah give us ability to do more.</p>

<p>From <cite>When the Moon Split 1998</cite> we explore some possible hikmah of the way the Prophet pbuh and companions dealt with the opression, however Allah knows the best</p>

			   <li>The companions (Ra) were being trained to face the torture and punishment on the path of Allah</li>
			   <li>They were able to endure due to their lack of attachment with the Duniya and eagerness for the bliss of Paradise</li>
			   <li>They were positive about the future of Islam knowing and beleiving that Allah will complete the matter and make Islam the dominant religion of God on the face of Earth</li>
			   <li>Peaceful preaching was effective in Makkah instead of fighting as that would trigger hatered and more bloodshed instead of the spread of the message</li>
			   <li>Fighting between Qurayesh and Muslims would mean to the outsiders that Islam came to initiate fight amongst family members</li>
			   <li>Muslims were few in numbers so the message would get hard to get outside of Arabia if all were engaged in fighting and getting killed at that stage</li>
			   <li>There was no real need for fighting as Islam was growing slowly but steadily</li>

                  <li>Prophet pbuh wanted to save and ensure the spread of the message and hence he sent some Mulsims to a land of just king</li>
                  <li>People of Abissinya were Christians (Abrahamic Religion) opposed to the people of Makkah who were pagans this was an advantage for Muslims</li>
                  <li>Prophet pbuh knew about Abissinya from his pbuh nursemaid Umm Aiman about the land and its people</li>
                  <li>As a merciful Leader Prophet pbuh was concerned about the safety and freedom of his pbuh followers and hence he pbuh permitted Hijrah option for them to go and live a safe life and spread the message</li>
<li>In the group there were Companions (Ra) like his pbuh dauther (Rukaiya Ra), son in law (Uthman Ra) and his pbuh cousin Jafar ibn Abu Taleb, which shows he pbuh was not taking a mere chance wih the life of some followers and including his pbuh beloved family members in that decision too</li>
<li>This also shows even though his pbuh family members had to suffer the same fate as his followers / companions (Ra)</li>
<li>These migrations (1st and 2nd Abissinyan migrations) lowered the status of Qurayesh as others in Surrounding areas were kind eough to provide shelter to their (Qurayesh's own tribesmen) people. And it als became obvious they (Qurayesh) were prosecuting Muslims because they worship only Allah and no one else</li>

                  <li>Rabbis taught them three questions to ask the Prophet pbuh <cite>When the Moon Split 1998</cite></li>
<ul>
                  <li>Rabbis taught Qurayesh to ask Prophet pbuh about the youth of the cave</li>
                  <li>The next one was to ask about the Jul Kar Nayeen, the one travelled thoughout both the East and the West</li>
                  <li>They also told Makkans to ask the Prophet about "Soul"</li>

<p><cite>When the Moon Split 1998</cite></p>

</ul>

<li>The first two questions Allah swt addressed in Surah Qahaf, surah no 18</li>
<li>To address the third question 17:85 was revealed, "And they ask you about the soul. Say, “The soul is something from the command of my Lord, and you are not given from the knowledge but a little.”"(more or less meaning and Allah knows the best)</li>

<li>Again another proof that the Prophet pbuh was not making things up on the go and was admitting his pbuh limits which were being revealed by Allah</li>

			   <ul>
			   <li>People of Qurayesh wanted to humiliate Prophet pbuh and prove him as a lier, so they asked him pbuh to perform miracles</li>
			   <li>Poor Qurayesh like many others of our days make the same mistake. It is not with the Prophets or anyone else who when they want can perform miracles, unless Allah gives them the ability to do so</li>
			   <li>And they have sworn by Allah the most earnest oaths, that, indeed, in case a sign comes to them, indeed they will definitely believe in it. Say, "Surely the signs are only within the Providence of Allah; and what will make you (i.e., the believers) aware that, when it comes, they will not believe?" (More or less meaning Quran 6:109)</li>
			   <li>Some of their demands are recorded in the Holy Quran, here are some of them (more or less translation of the meaning)</li>
			   <ul>
			   <li>They said, “We shall never believe in you unless you cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth.(Quran 17:90)</li>
			   <li>Or you have a garden of date palms and grapes, then you bring forth rivers from their midst in abundance.(Quran 17:91)</li>
			   <li>Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces, as you claimed, or you bring Allah and angels before us face to face.(Quran 17:92)</li>
			   <li>Or you have a house made of gold. Or you ascend to the sky, and we will not believe in your ascension unless you send down to us a book we may read.” Say, “I proclaim the Purity of my Lord. I am nothing but human, a messenger.” (Quran 17:93)</li>
			   <li>Nothing prevented people from believing, when guidance came to them, except that they said, “Has Allah sent a man as a messenger?” (Quran 17:94)</li>
			   
			   </ul>
			   <li>Its amazing how the above verses are found in Surah no 17, Al Israh where the greatest miracle of all times that were given to any other Prophet as we know were recorded, i.e. Prophet Muhammad pbuh visitng the seven heavens with angel Gabriel (as) which included witnessing the glimples of afterlife,  meeting with other Prophets and above all, meeting with Allah in a way that befits our Prophet pbuh and Allah swt which we are unable to comprehend and only know about this via Quran and hadith</li>
			   
			   <li>Allah responds to these, "If We had sent down to them the angels, and the dead had spoken to them, and (even if) We had gathered everything before them face to face, still, they were not to believe, unless Allah would have so willed. But, most of them adopt the way of ignorance. (More or less meaning of Quran 6:111)"</li>
			   
			   <li>Angel Gibarel / Gabriel (as) came to Prophet pbuh and gave two options as a response. The first option was to give the Qurayesh what they wanted as a sign or miracle, but they still remained as disbelievers they will be destroyed and the second was the one of mercy, where no miracles would be given as they demanded, but the door of mecry will remain open for them. Our beloved Prophet pbuh made the wise decision and took the option of mercy</li>
			   <li>Still there was a miracle shown by the Prophet pbuh of splitting the moon which the Qurayesh rejected saying that must be a spell that Prophet pbuh has done on them</li>

			   <li>Age 50 (approximately)</li>
			   <li>Prophet pbuh was at the lowest point of his pbuh llife after losing his pbuh wife, uncle and being rejected by the people of Taif</li>
			   <li><a href="https://quran.com/17/1">Firstly Prophet pbuh goes from Makkah to Jerujalem and from there to Heaven, Quran mentions the journey from Masjid al haram to Masjid al Aqsa</a></li>
			   <li>Some sources indicate Sura An Najm (53) verse 7 to 18 indicates the Miraaj part</li>
			   <li>More or less translation of Quran 53:7-18 :</li>
			   <ul>
			   <li>While he was in the highest part of the horizon, (53:7)</li>
			   <li>Then he drew near, and came down, (53:8)</li>
			   <li>so as he was at a distance like that of two bows (joined together), rather even nearer. (53:9)</li>
			   <li>Thus He (Allah) revealed to His slave what He revealed. (53:10)</li>
			   <li>The heart did not err in what he saw. (53:11)</li>
			   <li>Do you quarrel with him in what he sees? (53:12)</li>
			   <li>Indeed he saw him another time (53:13)</li>
			   <li>by Sidrat-ul-Muntahā (the lote-tree in the upper realm), (53:14)</li>
			   <li>near which there is Jannat-ul-Ma’wā (the Paradise of Abode), (53:15)</li>
			   <li>when the lote-tree was covered by that which covered it. (53:16)</li>
			   <li>The eye neither went wrong, nor did exceed the limit. (53:17)</li>
			   <li>He has indeed seen a part of the biggest signs of your Lord. (53:18)</li>
			   
			   </ul>
			   <li>In an attempt to prove the Prophet pbuh was lying, Makkans who were familiar with Jerusalem were asking the Prophet pbuh to describe the sacred mosque</li>
			   <li>Prophet pbuh, described everything in details</li>
			   <li>Makkans still disbelieved</li>
			   <li>If one wants to lie for their own benefit, this was a very wrong time to do so as they have no support at their home town without any family members to stand by them</li>
			   <li>Someone told Abu Bakar (ra) about this journey and Abu Bakar simply said, If he pbuh is saying so, then it must be true</li>
			   <li>From that day Abu Bakar (ra) was called "Siddeque", the one who believes</li>
			   <li>Prayer was revealed to Prophet during this journey, initially 50 times a day, later Prophet pbuh listened to the advise of Prophet Musa / Moses (pbuh) as he had experience with the Bani Israel people (his ummah) who were commanded less than 5 times  day and still were unable to carry on their duties. Finally Allah obligated 5 times prayer for Muslims, the Ummah of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)</li>

			   <li>The Prophet pbuh taught them more on Islam and asked them to take an oath of allegiance</li>
			   <li>This is known as the first pledge of Aqabah</li>
			   <li>This was a pact between the men and Allah which included the following conditions:</li>
			   <ul>
			   <li>They will not associate any partners with Allah in worshiping</li>
			   <li>They will not commit theft</li>
			   <li>They will not fornicate</li>
			   <li>They will not kill their children (Arabs used to kill their daugther as sons were more beneficial to increase their tribal strength)</li>
			   <li>They will not defame others</li>
			   <li>They will not disobey the Prophet pbuh when he pubh instructs them to do good</li>
			   </ul>
			   <li>Whoever fulfilled this pledge would receive his reward from Allah and whoever violated any part of it and was proven guilty would be punished in this world as an atonement. If however one breakes his pledge with Allah and Allah hides his sin, he will be dealth with Allah, Who would either forgive or punish him as He wishes</li>

                  <li>When the men who took the first pledge of Aqabah finished their pilgrimage, the Prophet pbuh sent Mus'ab bin Umayer along with them to teach them the Quran</li>
				  <li>It was not an easy job to go and do the dawah to non muslims there as the tribal chiefs would see this as a threat for them as well</li>
				  <li>Chief of Aus tribe, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh listened to Mus'ab bin Umayer about Islam and became a Muslim. This is the man who sent his cousin to stop Mus'ab from preaching the message thinking Mus'ab was deceiving their weak people (i.e. weak people from Aus tribe)</li>
				  
				  <li>Sa'd bin Mu'adh went back to his people and said, "What do you know about me as a man among you?". They replied, "You are our chief and the wisest man among us!". Sa'd said, "Well, I will not talk to the families of those who do not believe in Allah and His Prophet". As a result of this every man and woman in the tribe became Muslim except for Usayram, who became Muslim during the battle of Uhud. He was martyred during the battle even before making a prostration as a Muslim!</li>
				  <li>Sad bin Mu'adh later on became one of the most distinguished Companions of the Prophet pbuh</li>
				  
                  <li>Mus'ab returned to Makkah before the next Hajj. When Prophet heard about how Allah guided people of Madina to Islam, he pbuh was very delighted</li>
